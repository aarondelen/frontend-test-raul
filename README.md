## Resources Used

- **Fonts:** Poppins from Google Fonts
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS via CDN
- **Icons:** Heroicons (SVGs)
- **Images:** Unsplash (optimized hero image, 173KB)
- **Tools:** Image Color Picker (web browser) for color matching

## Assumptions

- Layout was developed step-by-step: starting from navbar to footer.
- Structure → Responsiveness → Functionality → Final tweaks.
- Git commits were minimal (3 commits) due to focus on translating the mockup faithfully.
- Logic-heavy components (carousel) were hand-coded without external libraries.

---

## Time Spent

Approximately **4–5 hours** including asset selection, debugging, and final completion.

---

## Browser Testing

- Tested using **Unlighthouse** for accessibility and performance.
- Verified responsiveness across devices starting at **320px** width using developer tools.
- Interactions like carousel movement and dropdown menus were confirmed smooth and functional.

## Notes

This project was simple in concept but challenging in execution, particularly implementing the carousel logic from scratch. Research, documentation, and StackOverflow were used to overcome specific intricacies. The page will also be hosted on **Vercel** for easy sharing with the developer team.
